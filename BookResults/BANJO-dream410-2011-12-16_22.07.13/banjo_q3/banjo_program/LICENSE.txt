    "Commercial Use" means any attempt, whether intentional or not, to
      copy, use, modify, or distribute, in whole or in part, Software or

      Software into a product or collection of products that will be sold
      or offered for sale, or distribution of Software commercially.

 2. LICENSE GRANT.  Licensor grants to Licensee a non-exclusive, worldwide,
    royalty-free, perpetual, non-transferable, single-user license to copy,
    use, modify, and distribute executable and source code versions of
    Software and related documentation for any use that is not Commercial
    Use.  Licensee is free to make modified versions of Software, provided
    that executable and source code versions of such derivative works are
    made readily available to others on these same terms, without fee or
    any other charge.  Unmodified Software or related documentation should
    be distributed by providing a link to Licensor's Software website (the
    URL in Apr 2008 is http://www.cs.duke.edu/~amink/software/banjo/).
    This license does not entitle Licensee to any installation support,
    technical support, telephone assistance, maintenance, or enhancements,
    modifications, or updates to Software.

 3. RESTRICTIONS.  Except as otherwise expressly permitted in this
    Agreement, Licensee may not (i) sell, rent, lease, or sublicense rights
    in Software; (ii) remove or alter any trademark, logo, copyright, or
    other proprietary notices, legends, symbols, or labels in Software or
    related documentation; or (iii) use the name of Licensor or Authors in
    any manner related to Software without their prior written permission.

 4. FEES.  Software is provided without fee, provided that Licensee's use
    is not Commercial Use.  If Licensee is interested in Commercial Use of
    Software, Licensee shall contact Licensor to negotiate a non-exclusive
    commercial use license, which may include a license fee.  If Licensee
    fails to negotiate such a license, but nevertheless uses Software for
    any Commercial Use, Licensee shall be deemed in material breach of this
    Agreement and agrees to pay monetary damages to Licensor, compensatory
    and possibly punitive.  In the event of a successful action brought to
    enforce this provision, Licensor shall be further entitled to recover
    reasonable attorney's fees and costs.

 5. TERMINATION.  License and the rights granted hereunder shall terminate
    automatically if Licensee breaches any of the terms or conditions of
    this Agreement, unless Licensee receives written permission from
    Licensor to exercise rights under the license in spite of a breach.
    Upon termination, Licensee agrees to destroy all copies of Software and
    related documentation, including copies made for backup purposes.

 6. PROPRIETARY RIGHTS.  Software and related documentation constitute
    published works and are protected by copyright and other intellectual
    property laws and by international treaties.  All rights, title to, and
    ownership interest in Software, including all intellectual property
    rights therein, belong to and shall remain with Licensor.  Licensee
    acknowledges such ownership and intellectual property rights and agrees
    not to take any action that jeopardizes, limits, undermines, or in any
    manner interferes with Licensor's ownership and intellectual property
    rights with respect to Software.

 7. MANDATORY NOTICE.  Both the notice below and the full terms of this
    Agreement shall be embedded in any location or medium in which Software
    or related documentation is stored, copied, or reproduced, and shall be
    loaded into computer memory for use, display, or reproduction in any
    copy of Software or related documentation, including derivative works.
    The notice to accompany the full terms of this Agreement shall state:

    remain in full force and effect.  (f) A waiver by either party of any
    term or condition of this Agreement or any breach thereof, in any one
