    * message=EVENT:<key=value:>+
    * message=ERROR <text>

  Added the following syntax for node:
  	* node['error']
	* node['event']

  eg: node: n1
    state = free
    np = 8
    properties = ib,switch1,highmem
    ntype = cluster
    jobs = 0/567403.sara.nl, 1/567403.sara.nl
    status = ..,loadave=0.00,message=EVENT:sample.time=1288864220.003:cputotals.user=0:iconnect.pktout=0,netload=3487600394,state=free,...

  example code:
  	p = PBSQuery()
	node = p.getnode(n1)
	print node.event['sample.time']
	print node['event']['sample.time']

=========== 3.6.0
  * pbs, new generated pbs_wrap.c, pbs.py fixes a bug in pbs_runjob()
    Reported by: Dennis Stam
    Fixed by: Bas van der Vlies 

=========== 3.5.0
  * PBSQuery
        The class functions of node, job and queue support old and new data
        structure.

        Changed the behaviour of the new data stucture, We can use it as
        dictionary and as class attribute, this is equivalent, eg:
          - print node['np'] and print node.np

        for a node we parse the 'status' line and split on '=' char, You now can
        use these statements, eg
          - print node.status.arch     (node['status'].arch or node['status']['arch'])
          - print node.status.nsession

        for a job we parse the 'Variable_List' line and split on '=' char, You now can
        use the statements, eg:
          - print job.Variable_List.PBS_O_WORKDIR
          - print job.Variable_List.PBS_O_HOME

 * new_rack_pbsmon.py
        Rewrite to new data structure and automatically determine how many nodes
        and racks cluster has and skip printing of empty racks (default), use -w/--wide
        for old behaviour.

   Author: Bas van der Vlies


=========== 3.2.0
	- PBSQuery:
	  New data structure. In the old structure it is a dictionary
	  with a value and the value is a string. This is changed
	  that dictionary values are now of type list or dictionary depends
	  on the value of the keyword, eg for a node:
	    - np = 2:
	      * node['np'] = [ '2' ]  

	    - properties = cores2, mem4gb, parallel 
	      * node['properties'] = [ 'cores2', 'mem4gb', 'parallel' ]

	    - status = arch=x86_64,sessions=22599,,size=70627864kb, ...
	      * node['status']['arch'] = [ 'x86_64' ]
	      * node['status']['sessions'] = [ '222599' ]
	      * ...

	 The data structure is activated by the function:
	  * new_data_structure()

        In a future release it will be come the default.
	example:
		p = PBSQuery()
		p.new_data_structure()

		nodes = p.getnodes()
		print nodes.np, nodes['np']

	Author: Bas van der Vlies

	- PBSQuery
	  For old and new data structure we now can use another syntax:
	   * node['np'] and node.np are equivalent

	  This new syntax works for all keywords.

	Author: Bas van der Vlies

	- Added iter object for job, node, queue and server objects, eg:
	  node = p.getnode('gb-r1n1')
	  print node.name

		   - get all nodes with property 'cores2' and only return the 
		     attributes 'state' and 'properties':
		      attrl = [ 'state', 'properties' ]

=========== Version 2.7.10

PBSQuery.py:
	Fixed an error. You always got all resources from eg nodes
	even when you supplied an attribute list where you only
	requested the 'state' of the node.

	Updated the inline python documentation

=========== Version 2.7.9

Fixed an error the previous version was in DEBUG mode. So
you get an lot undesired output on the screen.

debian package now also generated a package with the write 
version info.

=========== Version 2.7.8

Setup.py:
	Can also handle ROCKS installations + the version
	info is now the same as pbs.py
	Thanks to: Roy Dragseth

=========== Version 2.7.7

PBSQuery module: 
  It can now be used in daemon programs. The pbs_server closes
  the connection after an certain amount of time. This is fixed,
  before every query there is an new connection and if the query 
  is finished the connection is closed.
  
=========== Version 2.7.6

Now setup.py can also handle old Oscar Installations. 
Thanks To: Robin Humble

Fixed an print statement fix in new_interface.py:
Thanks To: Robin Humble

Made some improvements for PBSQuery module:
	- Updated the documentation
	- Added the has_key() function to all
 	  PBSObjects. So that the behaviour is similar to 
          an dictionary
	  Suggested By: Ramon Bastiaans
	
=========== Version 2.7.5
 Added PBSQuery module.  This module requires pbs.py and it a simple module 
 for querying the pbs server. The documentation is in the module. Use for 
 example ipython to read it.

 Added Support for Debuging the interface, You must edit pbs_wrap.c 
 and search for SARA_DEBUG:
	#define SARA_DEBUG 1
 Implemented by: Ramon Bastiaans

 examples/pbsmon.py:
 	- Fixed an error when regex fails to determine node number, 
	  no status was displayed
        - It will now display and 'j' if the node is free for the batch
	  system and a job runs on the node (SMP-systems).
 Changed by: Bas van der Vlies

 examples/rack_pbsmon.py:
 	- An pbsmon that display node info per rack
	- Edit the rack_pbsmon.py to adjust the values. It requires
	  that hostname contains rack and node id's, 
	  eg: gb-r<number>n<number>
 Contributed by: Walter de Jong

=========== Version 2.7.3
 The name SPBS is changed to the new name TORQUE (Tera-scale Open-source
 Resource and QUEing manager). 

 The interface support OPENPBS and TORQUE.

=========== Version 2.7.2
 Some minor changes to include files. Now the Scalable PBS keywords
 are also supported ( server attribute names: node_ping_rate and
 node_check_rate). This does not interfere with the openpbs software.

 pbsmon.py could not handle an one node cluster. Fixed it.

=========== Version 2.7
 Forgot to wrap the pbs_statfree() function. So we could not free
 allocated memory from functions that return 'struct batch_status *' 
 like pbs_statjob().

 pbsmon.py can now handle 2 and 3 digit hostnames. Patch supplied by
 Daniel Olson

=========== Version 2.6.1
 Setup.py now checks if all openpbs libraries are installed to compile the 
 package.

=========== Version 2.6

 Fixed a bug in the pbs python module. Forgot to map the pbs_statjob()
 function. This bug prevented to pass 'struct attrl' variables to this
 function. Thanks to Evelyn Shiu for reporting this bug.


=========== Version 2.5
 Added the OpenPbs logging functions (log.h and liblog.a). There
 is an example in the examples directory: logpbs.py

 Fixed a bug in examples/resmom_info.py used the default port for
 pbs_resmon if getservbyname fails.

 Fixed a bug in resmom code. If the user has no permissions to query
 the pbs_mom daemon a empty string is returned. Now we check for
 the empty string. So we do not get a python exception.

 Fixed a bug in setup.py forgot the exit statement when we did not
 find the pbs libraries.

=========== Version 2.3
 Bugfix in the pbsnodes-a.py. Forgot to import the sys module.

 Removed some obsolete code. 

 As for now we make use of the distutils module. So the package
 is automatically compiled and installed in proper directories, usage:
    python setup.py install
 This requires that the package 'distutils' must be installed. As for
 version 1.6 and higher it is in the distribution.

 Added a function that prints the pbs python interface version. So we
 can check if we have the right interface version:
 import pbs
 print pbs.version()
 

=========== Version 2.2

In this release we can query the pbs_mom daemon with the aid of
resource management functions:
   pbs.openrm()
   pbs.closerm()
   pbs.downrm()
   pbs.configrm()
   pbs.addreq()
   pbs.allreq()
   pbs.flushreq()
   pbs.activereq()
   pbs.fullresp()
   pbs.getreq()

There is also a python function:
   pbs.get_mom_values(id, [list]):
     id   - connection id of pbs.openrm(node-name, port-number)
     list - Is a optional paramter. A list of resource keywords

   If 'list' is not supplied then this function will get the values
   for the standard resource keywords, eg uname, loadave, .. + 'arch' 
   depended keywords. The arch feature is only implemented for linux, 
   but it can easily be ported to other oses.

   if 'list' is supplied then we only fetch values for the keywords
   that are in the list.

   The function returns a dictonary. The keys are the resource keywords.

   See 'resmom_info.py' for a example of this new feature.

=========== Version 2.0

The previous version was a simple interface above the PBS C API LIB.  This 
interface has gone a major changes. The most noticeable change is  that
the functions accept/return Python lists instead of C-lists.  So you can now 
use standard Python syntax for manipulating Python lists. If you are familar 
with the Python syntax then you will appreciate this new interface.

NOTE:
  This interface is NOT compatible with the old one

Here are some guidelines to convert your code to the new one:

The constructors for the struct has gone a major change:
  old code:
    temp = pbs.new_attrl();
    attrl_p = pbs.attrlPtr(temp)
    attrl_p.name = 'state'

  new_code:
     attr_l = pbs.new_attrl(1)   // Creates a list of attrl structs length 1
     attr_l[0].name = 'state'


The pbs_stat functions returns Python lists instead of C-lists. There is
NO next field anymore:
  old_code:
    temp = pbs.new_attrl();
    attrl_p = pbs.attrlPtr(temp)
    attrl_p.this = 'NULL'

    nodes = pbs.pbs_statnode(con, "", attrl_p, "NULL")

    while nodes.this != 'NULL':
      print nodes.name

      node_attrl = nodes.attribs
      while node_attrl.this != 'NULL':
        print '\t', node_attrl.name, '=', node_attrl.value
	node_attrl = node_attrl.next

    nodes = nodes.next 


  new_code:
    nodes = pbs.pbs_statnode(con, "", "NULL", "NULL")
    for node in nodes:
      print node.name
      for attrib in node.attribs:
        print '\t', attrib.name, '=', attrib.value

Another advantage is you can use the print statement to show the
connect of attrl and attropl classes:
   attr_l = pbs.new_attrl(2)
   attr_l[0].name = 'bas'
   attr_l[0].value = 'van der Vlies'

   print  attr_l[0]
   >> (bas,,van der Vlies)
    
I hope these examples illustrate the changes. If you specify a wrong type
for a function then function wil raise a Python exception.
